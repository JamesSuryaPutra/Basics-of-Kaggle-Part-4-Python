Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.\n\nOn average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.\n\nComplete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):\n    # Slot machine plays counted in number of times, including each payouts\n    payouts = [play_slot_machine()-1 for i in range(n_runs)]\n    # Calculate the average payout\n    avg_payout = sum(payouts) / n_runs\n    return avg_payout\n\nestimate_average_slot_payout(1000000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-22T07:21:18.780565Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-22T07:21:18.781196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-22T07:21:19.323933Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-22T07:21:18.781156Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-22T07:21:19.321018Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"execution_count":20,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"0.0159235"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When you think you know the expected value per spin, run the code cell below to view the solution and get credit for answering the question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq4.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-22T07:18:33.124302Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-22T07:18:33.124716Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-22T07:18:33.135912Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-22T07:18:33.124663Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-22T07:18:33.134656Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"4_ExpectedSlotsPayout\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: \n    \nThe exact expected value of one pull of the slot machine is 0.025 - i.e. a little more than 2 cents.

It should return the payout averaged over those `n_runs`.\n\nThen, once the function is defined, in order to estimate the average slot payout, we need only call the function.\n\nBecause of the high variance of the outcome (there are some very rare high payout results that significantly affect the average) you might need to run your function with a very high value of `n_runs` to get a stable answer close to the true expectation.
